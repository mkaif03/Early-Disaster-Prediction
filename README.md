#  Early Disaster Prediction using Machine Learning

This is an intelligent desktop-based application that predicts natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and cyclones using machine learning models. It alerts users in real-time with an interactive GUI, sound alerts, and report generation.

---

##  Features

-  Predict disasters (Flood, Earthquake, Cyclone, or None) using ML
-  Visual prediction charts using `matplotlib`
-  Interactive GUI built with `customtkinter`
-  PDF Report generation with disaster result
-  Sound alert system for high-risk predictions
-  Dynamic input handling from `latest_input.csv`
-  Model retrainable via `train_model.py`
-  Structured logging of predictions

##  How the Model Works

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Input Features**:
  - Temperature
  - Rainfall
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
- **Training**: `train_model.py` trains the model using `flood_dataset.csv`
- **Prediction**: `predict.py` reads from CSV or GUI input and uses model to predict

---

##  GUI Functionalities

-  Accept user input (4 parameters)
-  Display prediction result with confidence
-  Real-time plot of disaster probability
-  Trigger sound if disaster is likely
-  Export results into PDF report
-  Auto-load trained model for faster inference
